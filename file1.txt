hello

    Open the Terminal application:
        Now you will execute command line in your Terminal (each of them start with $)
    Install VirtualBox: $ sudo apt-get install virtualbox
    Install Vagrant: $ sudo apt-get install vagrant
    Add the Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal) image to your box list: $ vagrant box add ubuntu/focal64 Warning: this step can take time
        Many other images are available here
    Create your first virtual machine:
        $ vagrant init ubuntu/focal64 -> it will generate a Vagrantfile with base = "ubuntu/focal64" - you donâ€™t have to execute this command line everyday, only once, to create a new virtual machine
        $ vagrant up -> it will start your virtual machine
        $ vagrant ssh -> now you are inside your virtual machine.
